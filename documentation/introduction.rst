Why would someone customize and build their own keyboard?
=========================================================

Explain the motivation and reasoning for custom (ergonomic) keyboards.

* ergonomics
* avoid wrongly hitting the keys
* typing speed
* price of ergonomic keyboards

For the motivation it is good to add a little bit of history/reasoning of the most common keyboard layout. 

Some nice introduction videos:

Some concepts that will be explained more in depth later on:

* Types of keyboards
* How to get all the functionality of a full keyboard with less keys?
* Ergonomic considerations when designing a custom keyboard
