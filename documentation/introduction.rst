Why would someone customize and build their own keyboard?
=========================================================

Explain the motivation and reasoning for custom (ergonomic) keyboards.

* ergonomics
* avoid wrongly hitting the keys
* typing speed
* price of ergonomic keyboards

For the motivation it is good to add a little bit of history/reasoning of the most common keyboard layout. 

Some nice introduction videos:

Some concepts that will be explained more in depth later on:

* Types of keyboards
* How to get all the functionality of a full keyboard with less keys?
* Ergonomic considerations when designing a custom keyboard

Finally, there is a difference between creating a custom keyboard and creating
a custom ergonomic keyboard. In the latter, it is important to know the reasons
why each choice is made to improve the ergonomics so that one uses it correctly.
For example, having a split keyboard can help with shoulder strain but not if
placed very close together or very far appart.
