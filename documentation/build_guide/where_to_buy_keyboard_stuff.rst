Where to buy keyboard stuff?
============================

PCBs
----

JLCPCB and PCBWay are the two large fabricators in China. 
JLCPCB is known for having competitive prices, particularly if you're making 
a PCB smaller than 100mm x 100mm. (Not super common for keyboards, 
but folks have pulled it off.) PCBWay is also another popular Chinese fab.
Stateside, OSH Park has made a name for themselves with strikingly purple PCBs.
They're a bit more expensive then their overseas counterparts, 
but they do have a faster turnaround time.
