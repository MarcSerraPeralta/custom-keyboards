Keyboard software
=================

Seems like the QMK and ZMK are very similar in functionality (maybe QMK a little bit more customizable). 
However, ZMK supports wireless keyboards while QMK does not. So probably choose ZMK. 

Most wired Arduino Pro Micro and RP2040 based keyboards use the popular QMK firmware.
Meanwhile, wireless keyboards leveraging the Nice!Nano microcontroller typically employ ZMK instead.
