Reducing travel distance on choc switches
=========================================

This are some useful comments from a thread in reddit:

I'm with you on this. I mod all my switches. On chocs, even sunsets, I either open them up and add a very thin silicone dampener (~1mm) inside on either side of the plunger, or add that under the keycap (depending on the type of cap). It softens the bottom out nicely.

On the Sunset, it reduces the travel just right so the finger just passes the bump, but doesn't yet accelerate enough before hitting the dampener.

The material I use is the "waste" from between bumpons, cut to precisely fit inside the switch under the plunger, or on top of the switch under the keycap. So I've collected hundreds of small bumpons I'll never use just so I can get the material in between to use in my switch mods.

So it's not just me alone over here, supposedly "not typing on mechanical switches incorrectly"; that's a relief to hear. As luck would have it, I have a sheet of bumpon leftovers from the kitchen cabinets; worth a try. The action you're describing -- bottoming just after the bump and actuation -- sounds exactly like what I want to achieve, without having to resort to disassembling my switches.

Hmmmmm... bumpon material didn't work for me; the adhesive is weird and greasy and the thing keeps sliding off. (Maybe that's why they keep falling off our cabinet doors...) But I cut out a little gasket from 2mm EVA craft foam, and it seems just about right! 1mm wasn't enough for me, 2mm prevents it from actuating (as I discovered when trying to stack up two layers of 1mm bumpon), but the 2mm craft foam compresses just enough to stop right at the actuation point. Beautiful; thanks for guiding me in the right direction!

Someone mentions down below that I could print this out of TPU, which is appealing because I don't relish the thought of cutting 59 more gaskets...

okay, I opened up a few switches and put the bumpon material at the bottom of the plunger (the flat areas beside the spring, not underneath the spring as some were suggesting with O-rings). It's the perfect travel distance now, and there's nowhere for the bumpons to slide off! It's a bit of work though, naturally, so I think I'll wait until I get new springs before I do the rest of them.

Anyhow, just came back here to say thanks so much for the idea u/phbonachi !

Really glad it's working for you.

It's most definitely tedious. I would set up a "switch shop" over holiday breaks beside my partner's puzzles, and we'd plug away with some holiday special on the TV.
