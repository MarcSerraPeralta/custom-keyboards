Generating the layout configuration file
========================================

This section is about how to go from an idea/drawing of a layout to an actual 
configuration file which can be used to generate the PCB files. 

Ergogen (https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) allows to generate the PCB files and other
useful files from a configuration format. The project has an interactive website but can 
also be installed from GitHub. It has more than 800 stars in GitHub. 
The documentation can be found in https://docs.ergogen.xyz/metadata. 

A high-level tutorial can be found in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_VuXVErD6E

(I think it would be useful to explain a full configuration YAML file here)


General concepts for building the layout configuration
------------------------------------------------------

The layout information/configuration is stored in a YAML file. 
The main parts in the layout file are the ``"points"``, the ``"outlines"``,
and the ``"pcbs"``. 
The points part describes the poisition of the keys, the outlines
part describes the PCB outlines, plate and case, and finally the pcbs part
describes the wiring of the keys and the microcontroller used.

Another part is the ``"units"``, which include a description of units to 
be used when describing the points. By default we have the following units:

.. code:

   U: 19.05 # 19.05mm MX spacing
   u: 19 # 19mm MX spacing
   cx: 18 # 18mm Choc X spacing
   cy: 17 # 17mm Choc Y spacing


Points
------

For defining the points, we have several layers of abstractions to make the
process easier. The top layer are the "zones", which correspond to a set of 
points or anchors. Usually, a zone correspond to a column of keys.
The middle layer are the "anchors", which allow to place points from an 
existing starting point (or anchor) through translations and rotations.
Finally, the bottom layer are the points, which correspond to a set of
``x, y, r`` coordinates that is used to specify the center (``x, y``)
and the orientation (``r``) of the keys. 

The YAML file will have the following structure in the points part:

.. code:

   points:
     zones:
       <zone_name>: # A unique key for each zone
         anchor: # Optional anchor to position the zone, default = [0, 0, 0Â°]
         columns: 
           <column_name>: # A unique key for each column within the zone
             rows:
               <row_name>: <defs> # Key-level attributes set here apply to this key alone
             key: <defs> # Key-level attributes set here apply to the whole column
         rows:
           <row_name>: <defs> # Key-level attributes set here apply to the whole row
         key: <defs> # Key-level attributes set here apply to the whole zone
     key: <defs> # Key-level attributes set here apply to ALL zones


Note that in each zone, we can have multiple columns because sometimes we
want to have several columns at the same level, i.e. all the keys in a 2D grid.
The number of keys in each zone is the product of the number of columns and
the number of rows. By default they correspond to a 2D square grid, but they can be 
staggered or rotated (see below). If one wants different amount of keys in
each column, then one has two define a zone for each of them.

All the configuration is done through the use of ``key``s. They can contain any
metadata as attributes, but only some of them have meaning for layout out positions.
The useful keys can be found in: https://docs.ergogen.xyz/points#keys
An example of how the keys are used to setup the layout can be found in:
https://docs.ergogen.xyz/points#layout

The zones can be rotated (``rotate``) and mirrored (``mirror``) as a whole.

To define the correct size of the keys (e.g. Choc), use the following code:

.. code:
     
   points:
     key:
       width: cx
       height: cy
       spread: cx
       padding: cy
     zones:

As a summary, the width and height determine the size of the rectangles
representing the keys. The spread and padding represent the horizontal and
vertical separation between columns and rows. In this example, if any columns
and rows are added, the output will be a 2D grid without space between keys. 

With these tools in mind (as well as all the keys described in the Ergogen
documentation), one should be able to draw the rectangles in the specific
position one wants. 
The next section (Outlines) describes how to define outlines for the PCB, 
case, ...

Notes:
- When copying the layout from an svg file, Inkscape can display the rotation
  of an object from the XML editor. The angle is reported inside the rotate
  function in the transform attribute.
- When rotating and moving the columns, remember that the ``"spread"``, 
  ``"stagger"`` and ``"splay"`` refer to the horizontal movement with respect 
  to the center of the bottom key in previous the column. And the horizontal
  movement and vertical movement is with respect to a rotated reference system
  given by the previous column. I have created a small script to get these
  parameters from easily measurable parameters in an svg file.
- The size of the Choc MBK keycaps is 17.5x16.5mm but the spacing is set up by 
  default to be 18x17mm (``cx, cy``) to avoid the keycaps touching each other. 


Outlines
--------

As the name suggest, this part defines the outline of the pcb, case and others. 
We want the keys to be in a single solid shape, i.e. we want them to be in the same board,
therefore we need to add shapes and run boolean operations to get a final outline.

Each entry in the outlines, will represent a different outline. The design of the
final outline is based on defining several outlines for each step, as one can 
perform boolean operations with each outline. Therefore, the structure of the 
outlines usually follows:

.. code:

   outlines:
     raw:
       ...
     first:
       ...
     second:
       ...
     final:
       ...

The first part is joining the keys that are "together", e.g. the ones (almost)
touching each other. This is achieved by ``"bind"`` which grows the keys by
the specified amount in each direction to join them when they overlap. 
The ``"bind"`` parameter needs to be specified in the points part, but in order
to be applied, one needs to specify ``bound: true`` in the outlines. 
Note that the ``"bind"`` can be specified for all the pieces by placing
its definition together with the width, height, ... at the top of the points part.

In the first outline (usually called ``"raw"``), we want to draw all the rectangles
defined in the points part and perform the binding. This can be achieved by

.. code:

   raw:
     - what: rectangle
       where: true
       bound: true
       size: [cx, cy]
       corner: 0

The ``"raw"`` outline has only one part (one element in the list) which describes
that we want to draw rectangles for all the points defined in the points sections
with size ``(cx, cy)`` (this is for Choc MBK keycaps). We also want to bind the
rectangles using the parameter ``"bind"`` and we do not want to round the corners.
The arguments that the ``"bind"`` parameter takes are described in the Ergogen 
documentation.

To make the configuration of the outline easier, I recommend drawing the
keys using

.. code:

   keys:
    - what: rectangle
      where: true
      size: [cx, cy]
      operation: stack

The important thing here is that we are using ``"stack"`` as the operation, 
because then Ergogen does not merge the overlapping/touching rectangles
into a single shape, thus we can see each individual key. 

Once the a desired (final) outlines has been achieved, these extra rectangles
need to be removed.

To better fine tune the ``"bind"`` parameters, one can change this parameter
for each specific rectangle, column, and/or row.

To check: I don't know if it is possible to use ``corner`` together with ``bound: true``.


Cases
-----

The structure of this field is very similar to the outlines and, in fact,
it uses the outlines defined previously do build the cases. 
The documentation in ergogen describes the different options (not that many)
for building the cases. 
The most simple design might be the following:

.. code:

   outlines:
     final: ...
     outer:
       what: outline
       name: final
       expand: 3 # thickness of the case walls (in mm)

   cases:
     my_case:
       - what: outline
         name: outer
         extrude: 10 # height of the whole case
       - what: outline
         name: final
         extrude: 8 # 10 - 8 = 2 mm thickness of the case bottom
         shift: [0, 0, 2] # move this piece up the thickness of the case bottom
         operation: subtract

It is also useful to create some cylinders to hold the PCB in place.
One can even add some screws on it to hold it even better, see:
https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-part4-footprints-cases/
If one uses screws, remember to make the same holes in the PCB for the
screw to go through it.


PCBs

**Why do we need to use diodes?**
If more than two keys are pressed at the same time, this could cause "ghosting",
in which other keys (that are not pressed) are recorded as pressed. 
An example of this phenomenon is explained in:
https://www.dribin.org/dave/keyboard/one_html/

**How to wire the diodes?**
The diodes are placed after the switches (in a given column) before merging
the wire into the row column, thus only allowing current from the column
to the row. A circuit diagram can be found in:
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/66691/which-kind-of-diodes-i-should-use-in-buttons-keys-matrix-input-making-gaming-k
One classification of the diodes is regarding if they require
"surface mount device" (SMD) pads and "through hole" (TF) pins.
See ``routing_a_pcb`` for more information.

**SMD vs TH**
"I'm generally a fan of SMD diodes for keyboards. They're a little more fiddly,
but you don't have to worry about the trimmed through hole leads getting in 
the way of anything. SMD diodes are also shorter than the hotswap sockets we're
working with, so they don't introduce any new design considerations there.
Despite all this, I kept the dual SMD and TH diode footprint on our example keyboard design.
Having at least one through hole component on each key switch allows us to 
more easily hop back and forth from the front and back of the keyboard."
