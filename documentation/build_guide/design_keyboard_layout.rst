Designing a custom keyboard
===========================

What is a good way of designing a custom keyboard?

My approach involved: (1) using ergopad, (2) using pen and paper, 
(3) digitising the layout, (4) print and final test.
Pictures and files about the process can be found in ``my_keyboard`` folder.

1. Using Ergopad and a tablet
-----------------------------

Ergopad (https://pashutk.com/ergopad/) is a useful website that allows to 
determine the best placement of the keys by simply tapping on a tablet. 

Neverthless, I found that I need to rest my hand on the tablet when tapping it
in order put the hand in the most confortable position (and thus the one I
should be using for the keyboard. 

However, it is useful to see more or less how the keyboard should look like. 


2. Using pen and paper
----------------------

In the end, I designed my custom keyboard layout with a pen and paper following
a little bit the way Ergopad works. I drew it for only my right hand because
I am going to mirror it for the left one. 

It took me several iterations until I found a draft layout that worked quite well. 
Remember that one should put the hand in the same position that they are going to
use when typing (e.g. with wrist support) when testing the custom keyboard layout.
Also take into account the size of the keycaps.


3. Digitising the layout
------------------------

I digitised the layout that I drew with pen on paper using Inkscape. 
This process allows to draw the exact size of the keycaps and also flip
the keyboard to get the other hand. 
Note that the size of the Choc MBK keycaps is 17.5x16.5mm but the spacing is set 
up by default to be 18x17mm to avoid the keycaps touching each other. 

Once finished, I printed it to test again that the layout works for me but now
for both hands.
