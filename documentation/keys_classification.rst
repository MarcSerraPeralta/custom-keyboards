Sockets, key switches, and keycaps
==================================

Sockets = place where the key is hold. The hotswapable sockets allow to remove the 
keys without having to desolder them. 

Key switch = actual "button"/switch that triggers if a key has been pressed. It does not 
include the top cover where (usually) the letters are printed on. 

Keycap = cover for the key where (usually) the letters are printed on. 


Types of switches
-----------------

Classification based on how they feel/sound:

* Clicky
* Tactile
* Linear

A good description of all of them is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL9j06siA0


Classification on their travel distance:

* "Normal"
* Low profile
* Ultra low profile (scissors)

The type of switches that macbooks have are super low profile, like the CHERRY MX Ultra Low Profile.
An example of custom keyboard using this type of switches:

The switches can be bought from:

These switches are not hotswappable.
Another type of switches to check out are the Kahli X-switches, which are similar to the cherry MX ULP:

O-rings (no switches): they can be used to reduce the travel distnce of the keys.
There is a post of someone asking on how to reduce the travel distance of choc switches with O rings:

Here it says how to install O-rings to choc keys:
