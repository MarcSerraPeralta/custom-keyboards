Extra hardware features
=======================

Reset button
------------

A useful feature is a reset button, which resets the microcontroller (needed
for flashing the device or if something goes wrong). 

From the nice!nano documentation (https://nicekeyboards.com/docs/nice-nano/getting-started/), 
"One of the great things about the nice!nano is how easy it is to flash the device. 
To jump into the bootloader all you need to do is double tap reset. 
You can do this by either double tapping your reset button on your keyboard, 
or you can double tap RST and GND pins on the nice!nano quickly with tweezers."

Therefore, the reset button needs to connect the ground (GND) and the reset (RST).



On/Off button 
-------------

This is only important for wireless keyboards as one should turn it off to
avoid wasting battery. 


Drawings
--------

It is possible to draw some vector graphics in the PCB (using Silkscreen). 
I still need to check how to do that...
