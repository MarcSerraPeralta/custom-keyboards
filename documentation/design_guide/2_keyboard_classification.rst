Types of keyboard layouts
=========================

This section contains information about
(1) number of keys
(2) split vs no-split
(3) staggering

There are great articles and videos in the Internet containing this 
information. I found the following one quite comprenhensive and well summarized:

As a quick summary:
- Split = 2 parts / No-split = 1 part.
- Number of keys are expressed in percentage (where 100% is the Full Size keyboard)
  or directly as number of keys.
- Staggering: Ortholinear = 2D grid / Row stagger / Column Stagger.

The linked video explain the motivation for using an splt row-staggered
approach when designing ergonomic keyboards.
It is good to know the origin/motivation of the different choices when making decisions
of the design.
One can use common keyboard layouts for inspiration or choose one of them to build
instead of designing a custom one.

Some used sentences when talking about ergonomic keyboards:
- "keys are distance-one away from the home position" = the home position correspond
  to the keys where the fingers rest when one is not typing in the keyboard. 
  In the standard QWERTY layout, this corresponds to the ASDFJKL;.
  The sentence means that any can be reached by moving a finder from the home
  position by a distance equivalent to a key width or height (including diagonally).


Layouts with custom names
-------------------------

Some layouts are very common and have their own names.
See ``2_keyboard_names.csv`` for some common keyboards.
