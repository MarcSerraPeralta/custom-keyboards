Sockets, key switches, and keycaps
==================================

It can be quite surprising to talk about key switches and keycaps this early
in the design of a keyboard. However, different switches and keycaps have
slightly different sizes, therefore it is better to choose them before
starting to draw a layout of the keys, as one might later want a specific
keycap that is slightly larger than what considered, so the whole layout
needs to be updated.

The definitions for the elements in the title are:
- Sockets = place where the key is hold. Hotswapable sockets allow to remove the 
  keys without having to desolder them. The disadvantage is that they increase
  a little bit the price of the keyboard (50 hotswapable sockets ~8â‚¬).
- Key switch = actual "button"/switch that triggers if a key has been pressed. It does not 
  include the top cover where (usually) the letters are printed on. 
- Keycap = cover for the switch where (usually) the letters are printed on. 

There is a huge variety of keycaps and switch options (people can be very picky).
For custom keyboards, I have only seen mechanical switches being used, however
there exist more types. The main choices depend on the "feel" when pressing the
switch and its "sound" (people even mod or lube switches for achieving a 
specific sound).
Regarding keycaps, the main options are the "finish" in the surface, the profile
of the keycap (flat, rounded, ...), and art decoration for the letter.


Types of switches
-----------------

Classification based on how they feel/sound:

* Clicky
* Tactile
* Linear

A good description of all of them is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL9j06siA0

Classification on their travel distance:

* "Normal"
* Low profile
* Ultra low profile (scissors)

The type of switches that macbooks have are super low profile, like the CHERRY MX Ultra Low Profile.
An example of custom keyboard using this type of switches:

The switches can be bought from:

These switches are not hotswappable and seem to be difficult to hand-solder.
Another type of switches to check out are the Kahli X-switches, which are similar to the cherry MX ULP:

**Common switches**
- Cherry: size 18.5 x 15.6 x 15.6 mm
- Kailh: size ?? x ?? x ?? mm

**Modifiers of the switches**

O-rings: they can be used to reduce the travel distnce of the keys.
There is a post of someone asking on how to reduce the travel distance of choc switches with O rings:

Here it says how to install O-rings to choc keys:
