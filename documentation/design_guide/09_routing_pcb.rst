Routing the PCB
===============


If unsure that the pin ordering is correct/optimal, first route the PCB in a drafty/fast way
so that it is easy to spot any mistakes, or if it is better to move some elements 
(e.g. switches, buttons,...) to have better routes.


Tips:
* To allow for the traces to have any angle, go to Route > Interactive Router Settings >
  > Highlight Collisions > tick free angle mode
