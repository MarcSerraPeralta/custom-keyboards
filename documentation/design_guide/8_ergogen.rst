Ergogen
=======

Ergogen is an npm package but can be run online in the following websites:
https://ergogen.ceoloide.com/
https://ergogen.cache.works/
I recommend the first one as it includes several useful footprints (thus it does
not require to install ergogen locally and copy-paste the footprints). 
For example, it (https://github.com/ceoloide/ergogen-footprints) has the footprints
for the nice!nano, supermini (nice!nano clone), reset switch...
