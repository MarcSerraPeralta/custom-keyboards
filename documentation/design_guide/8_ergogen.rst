Ergogen
=======

Ergogen is an npm package but can be run online in the following websites:
https://ergogen.ceoloide.com/
https://ergogen.cache.works/
I recommend the first one as it includes several useful footprints (thus it does
not require to install ergogen locally and copy-paste the footprints). 
For example, it (https://github.com/ceoloide/ergogen-footprints) has the footprints
for the nice!nano, supermini (nice!nano clone), reset switch...


Footprints
----------

To use custom footprints, one must install ergogen locally, which can be done
using: npm i -g ergogen

Then, create a folder called ``footprints`` and place the footprints inside.
The following is very important:
"When working with external footprints, it's required that you use the filename 
config.yaml for your Ergogen config. Secondly, we need to change how we call Ergogen. 
Instead of the usual ergogen config.yaml command, we need to pass our entire folder to Ergogen.
Without further ado, let's fire up Ergogen and provide it with our project folder: ergogen .
