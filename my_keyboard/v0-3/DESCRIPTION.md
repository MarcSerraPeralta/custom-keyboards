Description of my custom keyboard
=================================

**Strick choices**
- number of keys = 34 (ergonomics for the finders so that they do not have to travel more than one key distance)
- split = yes (ergonomics for the shoulders)
- wireless = yes (less cables on the table)
- wiring = direct (allowed by number of keys and being split, which allows for a simple design and does not require diodes)
- keyboard board = PCB (easier to wire than hand wiring and "easily" designed with Ergogen, which allows all other choices)
- microcontroller = SuperMini NRF52840 (cheapest option for wireless)
- firmware = ZMK (required for nRF52840 microprocessors, and allows for direct wiring)
- batteries = yes, 301230 110mAh Lithium battery (required for wireless, power for minimum several weeks)
- switches = low-profile choc (less key travel)
- hotswappable = yes (for reusability of keys and microcontroleer)
- display = no (longer battery life)

**(Easy) Customizable choices**
- keycaps = low-profile choc (thinner keyboard)
- keyboard layout = QWERTY (what I am used to and what all keyboards have)
- keymap = layers + home-row mods (for fitting everything in 34 keys)
- case = yes (more durability)

**Estimated Price (without shipping)**
- 34 switches (splitkb.com) = 1€ * 34 = 34€ 
- 34 keycaps (packages of 10, splitkb.com) = 4 * 4€ = 16€
- 34 hotswap sockets (packages of 50, splitkb.com) = 8€
- 2 SuperMini NRF52840 (AliExpress) = 2 * 5€ = 10€
- 2 lithium batteries (AliExpress) = ~5-10€
- 2 PCBs (minimum order of 5, JLCPCB) = ~12€
- 2 cases (own 3D printer, 200g of plastic) = ~5€

TOTAL = ~90€

Notes: 
* I couldn't find a cheaper alternative for the switches and keycaps in AliExpress,
but I will continue searching...
* The shipping can be quite expensive and one might have to pay extra for customs.
