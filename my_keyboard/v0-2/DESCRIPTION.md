Description of my custom keyboard
=================================

**Strick choices**
- number of keys = 34 (ergonomics for the finders so that they do not have to travel more than one key distance)
- split = yes (ergonomics for the shoulders)
- wireless = yes (less cables on the table)
- wiring = direct (allowed by number of keys and being split, which allows for a simple design and does not require diodes)
- board = PCB (easier to wire than hand wiring and "easily" designed with Ergogen, which allows all other choices)
- microcontroller = nicenano or equivalent (required for wireless, cheaper option)
- firmware = ZMK (required for wireless, and allows for direct wiring)
- batteries = yes, with duration of a month (required for wireless)
- switches = low-profile choc (less key travel)
- hotswappable = yes (for reusability of keys and microcontroleer)
- display = no (longer battery life)

**(Easy) Customizable choices**
- keycaps = low-profile choc (thinner keyboard)
- keyboard layout = QWERTY (what I am used to and what all keyboards have)
- keymap = layers + home-row mods (for fitting everything in 34 keys)
